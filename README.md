# Loan-Marketplace
Borrowers can propose loans and lenders can fill them. When a user fills a loan, they become a lender, and have the right to sell a fraction of the loan, or the entire thing. Each loan can have exactly one fractional owner. At most, user can have one active loan or loan proposal at a time. Active loans are loans that have been lent to. <br>
##There are four main tabs to be aware of:
###1) Propose Loan - Where users can make a loan proposal.
###2) Browse Loans - Where users can view and fill loan proposals.
###3) Browse Fractional Loans - Where users can view and buy portions of loans sold by the lender to the original loan
###4) Users Positions - Where users can view or delete their loan proposals, view or payback their active loans, and view their fractional loans.
