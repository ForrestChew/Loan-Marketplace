Borrowers can propose loans and lenders can fill them. When a user fills a loan, they become a lender, and have the right to sell a fraction of the loan, or the entire thing. Each loan can have exactly one fractional owner. At most, user can have one active loan or loan proposal at a time. Active loans are loans that have been lent to.  

**There are four sections to be aware of:**

 **1) Propose Loan**<br>
 Users can make a loan proposal, but can have only one at most.<br>
 **2) Browse Loans**  <br>
 Users can view and fill loan proposals, but can only lend to one loan at a time.<br> 
 **3) Browse Fractional Loans** <br>
 Users can view and buy fractions of loans. These fractions are sold by the lender to the original loan.<br> 
 **4) Users Positions** <br>
 If applicable, users can view or delete their loan proposals, view their fractional loans, and payback their active loans.<br>
